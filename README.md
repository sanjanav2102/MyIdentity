# My ID Card - First Flutter Project

Welcome to **My ID Card**, a Flutter application that represents a digital student ID card. This is my **first Flutter project**, built to explore UI design, layout structures, image handling, and widget styling in Flutter.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

This app displays a student ID card with the following details:
- A top `AppBar` with a logo and university information
- A QR code icon and profile photo
- Student name and registration number
- A row of barcode images
- Course and validity information

The UI is clean, responsive, and designed with Flutter's `StatelessWidget`, `Image.asset`, `Column`, `Row`, and various layout tools.
